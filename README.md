Computer vision is found everywhere in modern technology. OpenCV for Python enables us to run computer vision algorithms in real time. 

This book will walk you through all the building blocks needed to build amazing computer vision applications with ease. Book start off with applying geometric transformations to images. Book then discuss affine and projective transformations and see how anyone can use them to apply cool geometric effects to photos. 

This book will also provide clear examples written in Python to build OpenCV applications. The book starts off with simple beginnerâ€™s level tasks such as basic processing and handling images, image mapping, and detecting images. It also covers popular OpenCV libraries with the help of examples.

The book is a practical tutorial that covers various examples at different levels, teaching you about the different functions of OpenCV and their actual implementation.

### Summary
Learn to image processing respectively with basic data structures taught at university level. 

Chapters | Topic 
--- | --- 
1 | Applying Geometric Transformation to image
2 | Detecting Edges and applying image filters 
3 | Cartoonizing an image
4 | Detecting and Tracking different body parts
5 | Extracting features from an image 
6 | Creating a panoramic image 
7 | Seam Carving 
8 | Detecting shapes and segmenting an image
